I to L Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs with distinct features can be found as well. For instance, the Kryptops had a face mask, the Lanzhousaurus had teeth that were half a foot long, and the Limusaurus was completely toothless.

Don't forget to check out some of the more notable dinosaurs, either. You'll come across the Iguanodon, the Isanosaurus, and the Lagosuchus, each of which made a distinct mark in what we know about these creatures.
